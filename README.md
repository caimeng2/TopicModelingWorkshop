# SSDA workshop: topic modeling for exploratory text analysis

Topic modeling is one of those Natural Language Processing techniques that are less mature and constantly evolving. As an unsupervised machine learning model, it will help you get a sense of what your texts talk about without reading through the whole thing. This workshop will introduce you to the basics of topic modeling with tweets as examples, and you will walk away with chunks of code ready for your own exploratory analysis. No prior experience working with text data is necessary, but participants should have some background using Python in Jupyter Notebook and be comfortable installing a few Python libraries.
